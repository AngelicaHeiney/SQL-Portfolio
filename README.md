Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and transforming Amazon Sales data to uncover insights into sales performance, shipping patterns, and profitability. The dataset contains 3,204 rows and 9 columns, including information such as order and ship dates, product categories, sales figures, profits, and customer geography. The goal was to clean, transform, and analyze the data to identify trends, optimize decision-making, and visualize key insights.

SQL Skills Used:

Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing column formats.
Data Transformation: Calculating total sales, profit margins, and sales by month.
Joins: Combining data across related tables for better insights.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Simplifying complex queries for readability and modularity.
Aggregations and Group By: Summarizing sales and profit data by product categories, months, and regions.
Date Functions: Extracting and formatting dates for analysis (e.g., sales by month/year).
String Manipulation: Cleaning product names and categories for consistency.
